# Unity Resources
Collection of tools, guides and other resources for the Unity game engine and related topics. These are **personal recommendations** based on my own experiences.

*Note: Content made by Unity is omitted on purpose, as the goal of this repo is to highlight the work made by the community and because Unity tools and assets are widely known to most people. However, there are a few exceptions that I'd like to mention for their great quality and usefulness: TextMesh Pro, Cinemachine, PostProcessing Stack, and ProBuilder. You can download them using the Package Manager.*
