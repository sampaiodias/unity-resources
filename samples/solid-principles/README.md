# SOLID Principles
Script examples of how to use [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) in Unity.

* [Single Responsibility](Assets/Scripts/Single%20Responsibility)
	* A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
* [Open Closed](Assets/Scripts/Open%20Closed)
	* "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
* [Liskov's Substitution](Assets/Scripts/Liskov%20Substitution)
	* "Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program."
* [Interface Segregation](Assets/Scripts/Interface%20Segregation)
	* "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
* [Dependency Inversion](Assets/Scripts/Dependency%20Inversion)
	* One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
