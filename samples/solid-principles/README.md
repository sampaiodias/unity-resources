# S.O.L.I.D. Principles
Script examples of how to use [S.O.L.I.D.]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)) in Unity.

* Single Responsibility
	* A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
* Open Closed
	* "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
* Liskov Substitution
	* "Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program."
* Interface Segregation
	* "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
* Dependency Inversion
	* One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
